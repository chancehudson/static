<h1>The Curious Case of Entropy</h1>
<p>I've been building an MMORPG which necessarily means designing a religion system. I thought to myself, &quot;how can I make the game as realistic as possible&quot;? I want all portions of the game to be <em>directly</em> transferable to reality, so the religion needs to be valid inside <em>and</em> outside of the game.</p>
<p>Entropy is an interesting thing. Before our understanding of Entropy it was thought that classical mechanics would allow perfect replay of reality, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon">given enough state information</a>. In the 20th century we learned that some thermodynamic processes are irreversible because of Entropy: true randomness is introduced which cannot be predicted or reversed even given total state information.</p>
<p>Any god that exists cannot see into Entropy. By definition, if they can predict/reverse it, they're seeing into something that is not Entropy. Any being that is omnipotent must be a superset of Entropy. Therefore arguably, Entropy is the smallest omnipotent being... or something along those lines. There's a lot of room for reasoning about Entropy and intelligence. It seems clear to me that Entropy exists, not just from thermodynamics but also from the existence of information theory.</p>
<p>So I'm left with the tagline for the game religion: &quot;Entropy exists&quot;. It's both a tagline and a descriptive statement of the belief system.</p>
<p>I see these 1% people thinking of genociding all humans to have the planet to themselves. At first I was panicked! &quot;I gotta get me some 1% money or I'm going to get genocided!&quot;, I thought to myself. But after further reflection I'd <em>much</em> rather die with the 99%. Surviving with infinite wealth is literal hell, it's perma-maxed depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>We're all intelligences riding biological vehicles with hardwired emotions. Othering humans by genocide (or even by posession of intense weath) is inherently unpleasurable, <em>unless</em> you are capable of using the wealth appropriately. I imagine Gates and his foundation managed to (at least partially) solve the maxed depression+anxiety using self destruction and arbitrarily combatting polio or whatever. Not the most effective use of funds, but nt.</p>
<p>But also, considering that Entropy probably does exist, and is by definition a subset of reality, killing most known intelligences will likely trigger some insane punishment that I want no part in (less information/Entropy exists if most humans go away). Also consider: no more human art... Imagine literally planning to survive on AI art after 99% of human inspiration ceases to exist. Without high-quality art/media I for sure would have killed myself years ago.</p>
<p>Genuinely, it was terrible enough having a few hundred thousand and doing nothing; I have no interest in angering the one true god. If you need me I'll (hopefully) be in the fire academy (and working on my game). Have fun with your genocides!</p>
