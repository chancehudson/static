<p>multiplayer games are basically just agreement systems</p>
<p>a bunch of humans and a machine agreeing on reality</p>
<p>the reality can be arbitrarily complex, and now that we can prove knowledge in terms of mathematics (progcrypto) we can bind games into reality</p>
<p>e.g. any game that is verified to exist in a zk proof, truly exists, provided all details are captured. e.g. it's possible to change details and calculate future alternative outcomes that were verified to not exist (in all realities where mathematics exists [assuming our hardness assumptions are true])</p>
<p>it should be possible to completely prove a realtime 2d platformer with thousands of distributed human participants</p>
<p>it creates quite a lot of quantum information <img src="/blunder.jpg" width="20px" height="auto" /> ? ?????</p>
<p>so we just make a game engine compatible with modern cryptography and insert provable ai</p>
<p>artificial intelligence and cryptography are the only binding mechanisms we need to spawn another reality</p>
<p>ah maybe this is <a href="/2025_wikipedia_quantum_information.html">that</a></p>
