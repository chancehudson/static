it's natural to ask why we're the only life in the universe

the needle in a haystack concept is extremely convincing, basically time and space are very large and life is unlikely

so the odds of life existing at the same time and relative space as us is low

but instead i think life is a universal binary, the source of binary mathematics

either life exists or not. if we're not the ones to create more advanced civilizations, it didn't, and doesn't, happen

e.g. when our life as a planet ends, reality ends

so of course there's no other life, if there was they would be the life
