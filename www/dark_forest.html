<p>it's natural to ask why we're the only life in the universe</p>
<p>the needle in a haystack concept is extremely convincing, basically time and space are very large and life is unlikely</p>
<p>so the odds of life existing at the same time and relative space as us is low</p>
<p>but instead i think life is a universal binary, the source of binary mathematics</p>
<p>either life exists or not. if we're not the ones to create more advanced civilizations, it didn't, and doesn't, happen</p>
<p>e.g. when our life as a planet ends, reality ends</p>
<p>so of course there's no other life, it there was they would be the life</p>
