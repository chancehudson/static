<h3>zero knowledge proofs</h3>
<p>If i have the following system of equations i can use a zk proof to prove i know the answer to the system</p>
<p>I can prove i know some variables that make all the equations equal</p>
<p>if we can express programs as systems of equations we can verify input and prove execution</p>
<p>if we can prove knowledge of an execution we verify the existence of the program and some inputs in reality</p>
