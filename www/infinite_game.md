if we continuously prove a game state according to some rules in zero knowledge and commit state to public information systems with handles for expressing statements about the game state in zk proofs

the act of creating that information is itself valuable, assuming it's bound to something humans enjoy to do

and humans like to escape reality

so obviously they created games

damn they really took a systems programming language (C) and built the async runtime model of nodejs into a new language with a weird (but optimal ???) combination of keywords and control flow

and it's really fuckin good

like concretely it cuts mistakes by 80% or something insane (memory (runtime) errors). It also increases compile time errors, which makes the path to the error _more immediately clear,_ and thus easier to fix

the argument is, static errors are better. And it's trivially true lol

canonically it's a meme that runtime errors are [hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_hardness_assumption) to solve, so trading them for slightly more easier to solve errors is a good idea

but there is a certain ■■■■■■■■ about debugging an error that seems impossible to occur. A very nice despair with hints of anxiety for days, a mountain to overcome

but of course persistence solves well
