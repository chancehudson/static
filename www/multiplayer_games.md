multiplayer games are basically just agreement systems

a bunch of humans and a machine agreeing on reality

the reality can be arbitrarily complex, and now that we can prove knowledge in terms of mathematics (progcrypto) we can bind games into reality

e.g. any game that is verified to exist in a zk proof, truly exists, provided all details are captured. e.g. it's possible to change details and calculate future alternative outcomes that were verified to not exist (in all realities where mathematics exists \[assuming our hardness assumptions are true\])

it should be possible to completely prove a realtime 2d platformer with thousands of distributed human participants

it creates quite a lot of quantum information <img src="/blunder.jpg" width="20px" height="auto" /> ? ?????

so we just make a game engine compatible with modern cryptography and insert provable ai

artificial intelligence and cryptography are the only binding mechanisms we need to spawn another reality

ah maybe this is [that](/2025_wikipedia_quantum_information.html)
