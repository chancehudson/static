### zero knowledge proofs

If i have the following system of equations i can use a zk proof to prove i know the answer to the system

I can prove i know some variables that make all the equations equal

if we can express programs as systems of equations we can verify input and prove execution

if we can prove knowledge of an execution we verify the existence of the program and some inputs in reality
