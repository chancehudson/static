<p>I'm an Ethereum user and I'm lazy.</p>
<p>I still used Metamask in 2025 like a fool. I have a smart contract wallet, but it's single signer with Metamask. I thought this would be irrelevant, but it ended up being <em>quite</em> relevant.</p>
<p>A while ago I was using firefox on my computer (m2 air) as usual. Firefox showed a brief message indicating that it needed to do a factory reset. I ignored this and pressed enter to initiate. Firefox sucks so much lately that I was not surprised...</p>
<p>A few days ago i re-installed Metamask from the firefox extension store. I was going through an auth flow and did not properly check the extension that was installed. The top result was an extension &quot;MetaMask&quot; with the same logo.</p>
<p>I installed the extension and entered my seed phrase, pressed enter, and nothing happened. I tried again, with the same result. I clicked around and felt a sinking feeling realizing I'd been phished.</p>
<p>I checked etherscan and saw funds being moved out of my account. ~$800 was gone in 1 minute.</p>
<p>The smart contract wallet held ~$40,000. I was <em>panicked</em>.</p>
<p>Then i calmed down, loaded the metamask key in a different wallet, and slipped a transaction in draining the contract into a different account.</p>
<p>Big ups to the safe.global people, multisig on smart contract wallets is <em>extremely</em> safe.</p>
<p>Ima build a walletconnect desktop daemon in not javascript</p>
<p>// todo: add that rust walletconnect impl</p>
