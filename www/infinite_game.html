<p>if we continuously prove a game state according to some rules in zero knowledge and commit state to public information systems with handles for expressing statements about the game state in zk proofs</p>
<p>the act of creating that information is itself valuable, assuming it's bound to something humans enjoy to do</p>
<p>and humans like to escape reality</p>
<p>so obviously they created games</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>damn they really took a systems programming language (C) and built the async runtime model of nodejs into a new language with a weird (but optimal ???) combination of keywords and control flow</p>
<p>and it's really fuckin good</p>
<p>like concretely it cuts mistakes by 80% or something insane (memory (runtime) errors). It also increases compile time errors, which makes the path to the error <em>more immediately clear,</em> and thus easier to fix</p>
<p>the argument is, static errors are better. And it's trivially true lol</p>
<p>canonically it's a meme that runtime errors are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_hardness_assumption">hard</a> to solve, so trading them for slightly more easier to solve errors is a good idea</p>
<p>but there is a certain â– â– â– â– â– â– â– â–  about debugging an error that seems impossible to occur. A very nice despair with hints of anxiety for days, a mountain to overcome</p>
<p>but of course persistence solves well</p>
