<h1>Bureau of Entropy Analysis</h1>
<p>The BEA is responsible for analyzing entropy and determining changes to the game engine. BEA agents operate in the game world as characters (NPCs). BEA devices are items built or imbued with powers in the game world.</p>
<h2>Information Classification: For immediate public release</h2>
<p>The BEA is an organization dedicated to analyzing the entropy in reality. This includes any emergent phenomena (information patterns). Physical position and energy is considered information for the purposes of bureau jurisdication. The stated purpose of the BEA is as follows: improving bindings from physical reality to game reality.</p>
<p>This includes optimizing psycho-economic relations between humans and the game. The BEA operates as a non-profit.</p>
<h2>BEA jumppad-00</h2>
<p>The BEA jumppad is a deployable, single use, object that propels players vertically. Entities receive a single step acceleration to 700y, and cease experiencing vertical gravity for 30 steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deployment time: 60 steps</li>
<li>Operational lifetime: single use</li>
<li>Interacts with entities: players, mobs, items, player_damage</li>
<li>Dropped by: all mobs with level &lt; 20 at 1/100 rate</li>
</ul>
<p>A crude device, the jumppad-00 spawns a vertical platform that accelerates into the bottom of certain entities, pushing them upward. Entities are weightless while the platform exists. Created to help teams move vertically without navigating complex platform patterns.</p>
