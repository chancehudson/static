<p>the game uses a seeded rng for most mob spawns (except things like random boss spawns)</p>
<p>if each mob has a drop table with a finite amount of in game money it's possible to calculate the maximum amount of money that will be created over time T assuming N player each play for time T_p</p>
<p>the more players that kill mobs, the more money that is created</p>
<p>but it's not infinite because the mob spawn rates are bounded, the game space is bounded, and time is (arbitrarily) bounded</p>
<p>yes, over infinite time infinite money can be created. but i'm probably not going to live for more than 80 more years</p>

<p>TODO: real time dashboard showing stats like total circulating money, graph money created over time, connected players, etc</p>
