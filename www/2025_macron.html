<p>this macron dude is doing a good job</p>
<p>the media was playing the evil wife narrative</p>
<p>the thinking is: an <a href="https://keccak-doomsday.com/2025_old_people">evil old person</a> captured him as a husband and he is emotionally compromised</p>
<p>this is an example of a delusion</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>it's probably nonsense, he seems internally driven enough that the fate of the world/reality will appeal to the good in him</p>
