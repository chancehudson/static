<p>i think an infinite amount of quantum information can be extracted from a finite amount of matter</p>
<p>this isn't surpising given constant size cryptographic proofs of programs of arbitrary length or like bls signature aggregation, infinite information:data compression ratios. e.g. an infinite amount of information can be stored in 100 KB</p>
<p>this relies on creating a piece of data necessary to verify the information. e.g. in bls all public keys must be known in order to verify</p>
<p>so an infinite amount of information can be stored in a finite amount of data, but only a finite amount of information can later be read (bounded by amount of matter/free energy in universe)</p>
<p>art is similar, an infinite amount of meaning can be embedded in a piece of art, but the observer must know the references being made in order to observe them. but references are themselves quantum information</p>
<p>this parallels quantum information itself. An infinite amount of quantum information <em>can</em> exist, but only a finite amount exists in time by being observed by life before heat death</p>
