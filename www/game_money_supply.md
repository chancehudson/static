the game uses a seeded rng for most mob spawns (except things like random boss spawns)

if each mob has a drop table with a finite amount of in game money it's possible to calculate the maximum amount of money that will be created over time T assuming N player each play for time T\_p

the more players that kill mobs, the more money that is created

but it's not infinite because the mob spawn rates are bounded, the game space is bounded, and time is (arbitrarily) bounded

yes, over infinite time infinite money can be created. but i'm probably not going to live for more than 80 more years

TODO: real time dashboard showing stats like total circulating money, graph money created over time, connected players, etc
