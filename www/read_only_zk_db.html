<p>hey guys, so i'm thinking of how to build this. I need a package to develop and maintain in the package registry. I was toying with lattice crypto implementations but i think a db handle would be better.</p>
<p>I'm using <a href="https://github.com/spacejam/sled">sled</a> as a database in another project. It keys <code>[u8]</code> to records using arbitrary logic. If I standardize the key generation mechanism using a zk friendly hash function it should be possible to access using a db handle in noir.</p>
<p>This would be exposed as a cli utility that reads a sled database directory and outputs a merkle tree.</p>
<p>So ideally, in noir i would invoke an external program, passing arguments and receiving a standardized representation of data (noir types).</p>
<p>Essentially this would be an FFI for noir. This could initially be implemented as</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Hey guys, is there any file system access or ffi for generating witness data? Say i have a sled database, can i export a merkle tree representation to file(s) and then read that in noir? It would be cool to have readonly database handles in noir as a package</p>
<p>e.g. i have an sqlite database. I run a rust program &quot;ZKIFY&quot; on the database to generate an in place merkle snapshot of the database. I commit to the root publicly then can begin making public statements about the db on request. I take a new snapshot and publicly commit to a new root every hour</p>
<p>At the noir level there can be proofs of individuals having specific records, but also sanity checks about the state transition for the whole db. This state transition proof would be a nice form of legislation. e.g. the state transition proof can very specifically define operating parameters and be easily changed with votes/discussion in a pr</p>
